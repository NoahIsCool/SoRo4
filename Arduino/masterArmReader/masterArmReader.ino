/* Uses potentiometers and buttons on a master arm to control
 *  the slave arm on the rover.
 * This program is just for collecting the position from the master
 * The data is sent over USB serial to a computer (probably an UPboard)
 * 
 * ORDERING:
 * START | ID | shoulderPosition | elbowPosition | pitchDown | pitchUP | rollLeft/CCW | rollRight/CW | closeHand | openHand | average of all values
 * 
 * Notes:
 * -Buttons just report if the button is pressed or not, movement must be controlled at the master
 * -ID must be known by the serial master (computer)
 * -Uses 9600 baud
 * -If the average is disagreed by serial master and slave something went wrong
 * 
 * Protocol Used:
 *
 *  (-127) | USERID | DATA | DATA | ... | Average of all sent values |
 *  -127 is the start message 
 *  USERID is an int used to identify which serial device is running the program
 *  Average of all sent values is to ensure no data loss and for debugging
