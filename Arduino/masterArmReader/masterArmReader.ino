/* Uses potentiometers and buttons on a master arm to control
 *  the slave arm on the rover.
 * This program is just for collecting the position from the master
 * The data is sent over USB serial to a computer (probably an UPboard)
 * 
 * ORDERING:
 * START | ID | shoulderPosition | elbowPosition | pitchDown | pitchUP | rollLeft/CCW | rollRight/CW | closeHand | openHand | average of all values
 * 
 * Notes:
 * -Buttons just report if the button is pressed or not, movement must be controlled at the master
 * -ID must be known by the serial master (computer)
 * -Uses 9600 baud
 * -If the average is disagreed by serial master and slave something went wrong
 * 
 * Protocol Used:
 *
 *  (-127) | USERID | DATA | DATA | ... | Average of all sent values |
 *  -127 is the start message 
 *  USERID is an int used to identify which serial device is running the program
 *  Average of all sent values is to ensure no data loss and for debugging
 *  
 *  Potentiometer Values:
 *  The output to serial is in units of degrees and is sent as a 16 bit integer (your programming language should handle the bits you just need to know it's an integer)
 *  
 *  Buttons:
 *  The buttons are stored in the 7th byte of the message. (data[6])
 *  The byte has this structure (button 3)(button 2)(Button 1)(Button 0)(Button 3)(Button 2)(Button 1)(Button 0) 
 *  where 0 is unpressed and 1 is pressed. 
 *  
 *  To parse this byte I'd recomend using this method:
 *  To test if a specific bit is 0 or 1 the formula (byte) XOR (2**n) where n = 0 is the least significant bit
 *  will return an integer 2**n smaller than the original integer if the bit is 0. If the output of this XOR is the same number then that bit is not a 1.
