So the general idea for this year is to have one main file that can call any subprojects we make with little code editing. 
So there may be one shared library that handles all of the autonomous code with 3 functions being called from the mainController for example.
This way, the code can be highly customizable, easy to figure out what code does what and there arnt random dependancies in weird places.

So this is my first time setting up a project with subprojects so if you have strange problems compiling, let me know. I probably did something wrong
